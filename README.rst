Bryton GPS on linux
===================

This is an attempt to make Bryton GPS devices usable on Linux.


Code for the **Rider40** is now available in the **code** directory.

There is also branches for **Rider20** and **Rider35**:

- `Rider35
  <https://github.com/Pitmairen/bryton-gps-linux/tree/rider35>`_
- `Rider20
  <https://github.com/Pitmairen/bryton-gps-linux/tree/rider20>`_

It currently has the following functionality:

- Readonly not write support
- List track history
- List track summary
- Generate GPX (plain and Garmin extension) and TCX files.
- Upload to strava.com


The code is released under the GPL v3 license.

I have only access to a Rider40, but im interested in data from other
devices. See dump.py for an example how to read the data from you device.
It probably works with other devices.
