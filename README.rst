Bryton GPS on linux
===================

This is an attempt to make Bryton GPS devices usable on Linux.


Code for the **Rider40** is now available in the **code** directory.

It currently has the following functionality:
- Readonly not write support
- List track history
- List track summary
- Generate GPX (plain and Garmin extension) and TCX files.



I have only access to a Rider40, but im interested in data from other
devices. See dump.py for an example how to read the data from you device.
It probably works with other devices.
