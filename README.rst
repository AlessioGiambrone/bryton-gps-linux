Bryton GPS on linux
===================

This is an attempt to make Bryton GPS devices usable on Linux.


Currently there is no code available. Im just trying to figure out the
layout of the data on the devices.

I have only access to a Rider40, but im interested in data from other
devices. See dump.py for an example how to read the data from you device.
It probably works with other devices.


**Rider 40:**
